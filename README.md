# SUIT ‚òÄÔ∏èüõ∞Ô∏è Stellar Observation Simulator
Simulate what Sirius might look like when seen through SUIT. It simulates the predicted observation with the movement of the PSF due to satellite jitter/ drift.

## Usage/Examples

### PSF generation
Run `src/data/psf.py` to generate sample PSF from post-disasm data. The PSF is  saved in `data/interim/psf.fits`. A sample PSF is already generated.

### Batch processing
Use  `src/simulated_observation.py` to generate mock observations using PSF and user defined values. Processed images will be saved in `data/processed`

NOTE: This is prepared without any functions for easy testing and to extend it to further usecases, like implementing sun center information to mode the PSF.
